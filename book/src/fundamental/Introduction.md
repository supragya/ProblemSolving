# Fundamental Building Blocks and algos

[https://algomap.io](https://algomap.io) is a great resource to understand the important building blocks
one need to know in terms of problem solving.

Another great resource is Striver's [Last Moment DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-sheets/strivers-79-last-moment-dsa-sheet-ace-interviews).

The sections in here are curated subsets from these and what's also described is
how to implement them efficiently in rust.
